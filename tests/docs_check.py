    py tests/docs_check.py FILE ...   # just these

Why this exists
---------------
The skill and the toolchain are one product described in two places. `skills/ros-model/SKILL.md`
and the command docs tell an agent what the linter enforces, which files to read and which
examples to follow; `scripts/` decides what is actually true. Nothing connected the two, so the
prose drifted -- and drifted in the worst direction, because an agent BELIEVES it. Commit
04ddd6f had to correct twenty documentation claims that no longer described this repo, one of
which told an agent to delete values the grammar accepts.

Every check below is a class of drift that has actually happened here, not a hypothetical. The
point is not to police wording: it is that a fact restated in prose is a fact that can rot, so
each restatement that CAN be mechanically compared to its source is compared on every run.

What this cannot do
-------------------
Only mechanically checkable claims are checked. "RM065 fires when two nodes share a label" is
prose this file cannot verify -- that is what tests/roundtrip.py selftest and the oracle cases
are for. What it does cover is the boring half that rots silently: paths, identifiers, counts.

Exit 0 iff there are no ERRORs. WARNINGs are reported and do not fail the run.
