extract_golden.py -- pin the extractors' output to a committed golden file.

    py tests/extract_golden.py             # check
    py tests/extract_golden.py --update    # rewrite the golden after an INTENDED change

Why this exists
---------------
`scripts/extract_ros2_interfaces.py` and `scripts/extract_rossystem.py` are the deterministic
half of this plugin: everything they emit is supposed to be literal in the source, and an agent
downstream is told not to re-derive it. That makes a silent change in what they emit the most
expensive kind of regression here -- the output still lints clean, the oracle still accepts it,
and the only thing that changed is whether the model is TRUE. Nothing catches that except
comparing against output somebody has read.

So: run both scripts over `tests/fixtures/extract/src/`, a miniature two-package workspace with
a launch file, and diff every byte against `tests/fixtures/extract/golden/`. Any edit to either
script that changes emitted output shows up here as a diff to read and either accept
(`--update`) or fix.

The fixture is not the real robot
---------------------------------
The models this plugin was developed against come from a real driver tree that is not in this
repo and cannot be committed to it, so a golden keyed to that tree would only run on one
machine. The fixture reproduces the SHAPES that mattered there instead: a C++ package with
`generate_parameter_library` parameters and a non-literal topic name, a second C++ package with
two executables that each name their node in `main()`, a Python `rclpy` package, and a launch
file mixing project-local nodes with one that resolves against the vendored catalogue.
Not covered, and worth knowing: `controllers.yaml` controller-instance resolution, `.msg`
transcription (`--emit-msgs`), and `IncludeLaunchDescription` (which the extractor does not
follow at all).

Two named checks on top of the diff
-----------------------------------
A byte diff tells you SOMETHING changed, not what it means. Two bug classes have actually
shipped here, so they are asserted by name as well -- a failure should say which invariant
broke, not just print a diff:

1. A parameter whose `default_value` is the *string* `"false"` under a declared `bool` must
   render `false`. Python truthiness makes a non-empty string true, so the naive reading emits
   `default: true` -- the exact opposite of the source, and it passes every other check in this
   repo while asserting the opposite of the truth.
2. A topic name built from literals plus one identifier must produce a `# FLAG` carrying the
   candidate names as evidence, and must emit NO declaration for it. Emitting the candidates
   would turn a visible unknown into an invisible one: the realistic failure is a plausible
   subset, not a nonsense name.
3. Two `add_executable()` targets in one package must stay two artifacts. Merging them says
   one binary serves both sets of interfaces -- a false claim stated as fact, with no flag on
   it, which is worse than any flag.
4. A node built in `main()` as `rclcpp::Node::make_shared("x")` must be named `x`. Missing a
   literal breaks the one promise these scripts make, and a `.rossystem`'s `from:` inherits
   the wrong name silently.

Exit 0 iff every check passes.
