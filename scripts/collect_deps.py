collect_deps.py -- resolve a model's type:/from:/arrow references against the vendored
catalogues (assets/type_index.json, assets/node_index.json) and copy the winning
catalogue files into an oracle case directory, replacing the manual "figure out which
_deps files to hand-copy" step.

WHY THIS EXISTS: tests/oracle/cases/_deps/ is a hand-carried, confirmed-stale snapshot
(see assets/roscommonobjects/PROVENANCE.md) that someone has to remember to update by
hand. rosmodel_lint.py's RM083/RM087 already compute exactly which catalogue files a
model needs -- this script just runs the linter and acts on that.

Usage:
    python collect_deps.py <model-file> [<model-file> ...] <case-dir>
        Lints each model file with the catalogue enabled, then copies every catalogue
        file its RM083/RM087 findings named into <case-dir> (creating it if needed).
        This is a TRANSITIVE closure, not just the models' own direct references: a
        copied catalogue file (e.g. lifecycle_msgs.ros) can itself reference further
        catalogue types in its own field bodies (e.g. builtin_interfaces/msg/Time) that
        none of the given model files ever named directly -- those get pulled in too,
        recursively, until nothing new is found. A .rossystem model's resolved
        subSystems: entries are staged and re-linted the same way: the referenced
        .rossystem file is copied in and its own from:/type:/subSystems: references are
        followed recursively, so reusing e.g. turtlebot.rossystem also pulls in
        turtlebot3_node.ros2, hlds_laser_publisher.ros2, robot_state_publisher.ros2 and
        their .ros type deps without the caller naming any of them.
