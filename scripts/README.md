# `rosmodel_lint.py` — static linter for `.ros` / `.ros2` / `.rossystem`

Work item **E1**, CoreSense x Humanoid (Fraunhofer IPA).

A standalone Python checker for RosTooling model files. It accepts **`.ros`, `.ros2` and
`.rossystem`**.

It is no longer the *only* feedback available — Java 21 is installed and `tests/oracle/ask_oracle.py`
drives the real language servers for `.ros`, `.ros2` and (since a `.rossystem` server was built
locally) `.rossystem` too. The linter's role is now to give **fast, single-file, offline** feedback
in the edit loop, and to cover the checks the oracle cannot make (house style, rossdl
compatibility, provenance sentinels). Where the two disagree, **the oracle wins** — every ERROR in
this table has been confirmed against it.

`.ros` support was added 2026-07-21, closing a real incoherence: the skill instructs authoring
`.ros` files, and a package that defines its own message types *requires* one, yet the linter used
to reject the extension outright with `RM000`.

## Usage

> On Windows, bare `python` is the Microsoft Store stub and exits non-zero — use **`py -3`**.

```bash
python rosmodel_lint.py <file>...
python rosmodel_lint.py --json <file>...
python rosmodel_lint.py --min-severity ERROR <file>...
python rosmodel_lint.py --max-per-rule 0 <file>...    # show every occurrence
python rosmodel_lint.py --quiet "corpus/**/*.ros2"    # summary line only
```

Globs are expanded internally, so quoted `**` patterns work regardless of shell.

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Machine-readable output. Never capped. |
| `--min-severity {ERROR,WARNING,INFO}` | Suppress findings below this level. Default `INFO`. |
| `--max-per-rule N` | Text output only: at most `N` findings per rule per file (`0` = unlimited). Default `10`. |
| `--quiet` | Print only the summary line. |
| `--hook` | PostToolUse hook mode — see below. |

### `--hook` mode

```bash
echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"x.ros2"}}' | python rosmodel_lint.py --hook
```

Reads the PostToolUse event JSON on stdin, takes the written path from `tool_input.file_path`,
and prints `{"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}` on stdout when an **ERROR** survives. Clean
files, non-model extensions, malformed events and internal errors all exit **0 in silence** — a
linter that breaks the agent's turn on its own bad day is worse than no linter.

`PostToolUse` fires *after* the write succeeds, so blocking cannot prevent a bad file reaching
disk; it forces a corrective edit. The invariant is *"no invalid model survives the turn"*, not
*"no invalid model is ever written"*.

> *Added 2026-07-21.* `hooks/hooks.json` had invoked `--hook` since the plugin was scaffolded, but
> the flag was never implemented — the hook fired, argparse rejected it with exit 2, and **no file
> was ever linted by the hook**. Both the `.rossystem` and (newly added) `.ros2` handlers are now
> functional, verified against a clean file, a two-ERROR file, and a malformed event.

**Exit status:** `1` if any ERROR-severity finding survives `--min-severity` filtering, else `0`.

**Dependencies:** Python 3.8+, standard library, and PyYAML. Without PyYAML the linter still runs
every byte/layout check and reports the structural checks as skipped (verified — see
*Test evidence*), rather than crashing.

### Why layout rules fire per line

The real Xtext validators do not short-circuit either — `checkNameConventionsPackage` emits one
marker *per uppercase character*. A tab-indented file can therefore produce hundreds of identical
RM001s. `--max-per-rule` caps the text output for readability; the summary counts and the JSON
output always report the true totals.

---

## Authorities

Findings are derived from three documents, in this order of precedence:

| Authority | Path | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| Pinned grammar subset | `../docs/grammar-subset.md` | What the pinned oracle can lex at all |
| Validator rules | `../research/validator-rules.md` | Semantic constraints + their real severities |
| Emission profile | `../emission-profile.md` | Normative formatting style |

> **Note on paths.** The E1 task brief located all three under `spec/`. They are actually at
> `docs/grammar-subset.md`, `research/validator-rules.md` and `emission-profile.md` (repository
> root). No `spec/` directory exists. Content, not location, was used.

---

## Rule reference

Severity column is what the linter emits. The "Mirrors" column names the Xtend validator method or
the profile rule the check reproduces.

### `.ros` structure and message fields

Added 2026-07-21. A `.ros` file is **not** parsed as YAML — `float32 x` nested under an
un-colonned `Pose` is folded by PyYAML into a single multi-line plain scalar, silently discarding
every field. The `.ros` branch therefore runs its own indentation-stack parser
(`parse_ros_indent`), modelled on Xtext's `AbstractIndentationTokenSource`: an increase in indent
opens a `BEGIN`, a decrease closes `END`s, and **absolute column values are never assumed**. The
corpus steps 3/4/5/6/7/9 spaces and the real parser accepts all of it.

`RosValidator.xtend` declares **no `@Check` at all** on `TopicSpec`, `MessagePart` or
`AbstractType`. Apart from `checkNameConventionsPackage` there is no validator to mirror here, so
these rules encode the **grammar** rather than a validator, and every ERROR was confirmed against
`ask_oracle.py` rather than guessed.

| ID | Severity | Check | Mirrors / oracle evidence |

| `RM079` | ERROR | File uses the **brace** serialisation, not the indentation syntax | `RosTooling-NadiaHG` fork's concrete syntax; STATUS.md open question N2 |
| `RM080` | INFO | A `message`/`request`/`response`/`goal`/`result`/`feedback` section has no fields | Legal and common; surfaced because a bodiless body is also what data loss looks like |

`RM009` (duplicate name), `RM010` (uppercase package name, **ERROR**), `RM015`, `RM016`, `RM020`,
`RM021`, `RM040` (unsorted block) and `RM044` (`dependencies:`) are shared with the other two file
types and fire in `.ros` too. So do all the byte/layout rules `RM001`–`RM008T`.

**Two severities chosen deliberately against the obvious reading:**

- **`RM076` is a WARNING, not an ERROR**, even though the oracle reports an unresolvable reference
  as an ERROR (`Couldn't resolve reference to TopicSpec 'AllTypes'`). Linking is cross-file and
  this linter sees one file at a time, so it cannot distinguish "wrong shape" from "defined in a
  file I was not given". The hint says to treat it as an error.
- **`RM078` is a WARNING, not an ERROR.** Multiple fields per line parse fine. Rejecting them
  would fail files the real parser accepts — including the fixtures in `tests/oracle/cases/_deps`,
  which the oracle rates ACCEPTED 0E/0W.

An **unquoted, non-primitive** type token *is* `RM074` at ERROR, and that is not a guess: a spec's
qualified name always contains `/`, which no bare Xtext `ID` can express, so such a token can never
link — not even for a type declared three lines above it in the same package. Confirmed both ways
against the oracle (bare `AllTypes` → rejected; `"probe_msgs/msg/AllTypes"` → ACCEPTED 0E/0W).

**Corpus behaviour.** Over the 31 `.ros` files in `ros-model-examples`, the structural rules
`RM070`–`RM080` produce **zero** ERRORs. As of 2026-07-21 `RM001` is a WARNING, so there are now **zero** `.ros` ERRORs. (Previously 126 `RM001` tabs, all in the four
`slam_toolbox_msgs.ros` copies. RosTooling's own `basic_msgs/common_msgs.ros` and `ros_core.ros`
lint with **0 errors**.

### Names

| ID | Severity | Check | Mirrors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RM010` | **ERROR** | Uppercase in a package name | `checkNameConventionsPackage` (R3) |
| `RM011` | WARNING | Uppercase in an artifact name | `checkNameConventionsArtifact` (R2) |
| `RM012` | WARNING | Uppercase in a node name | `checkNameConventionsNode` (R1) |
| `RM013` | WARNING | Uppercase in a parameter name's **final dot-segment** | `checkNameConventionsParameters` (R4) |
| `RM014` | WARNING | `/` in a node/artifact name (grammar-legal) | rossdl launch generation |
| `RM015` | ERROR | Empty interface/parameter name (`'':`) | profile rule 20 |
| `RM016` | ERROR | RosNames position not expressible as `ROS_CONVENTION_A \| ID` | `Basics.xtext:394` |

The ERROR/WARNING split in RM010–RM013 is the single most important severity distinction in the
toolchain: four structurally identical Xtend loops, but **only the package one calls `error()`**.
The message wording tracks it precisely ("are not allowed" vs "are not recommended"). RM013 is a
WARNING despite its validator message saying "has to follow" — the call is `warning()`, and the
call wins over the prose.

RM013 implements the dot-suffix carve-out exactly: an uppercase character at index `i` is forgiven
iff `name[i:]` still contains a `.`. So `Foo.bar` is clean and `foo.Bar` warns.

### Quoting

| ID | Severity | Check | Mirrors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RM020` | ERROR | Unquoted `EString` containing `.` `/` `::` `-` or space | profile rules 10, 12, 13, 14 |
| `RM021` | ERROR | Quoted name in a `RosNames` position | profile rule 7 |
| `RM022` | WARNING | `.ros2`/`.rossystem` name unquoted where a bare `ID` would parse | profile rules 11, 12 |

`RM020` and `RM021` are opposites and both are ERRORs, because `EString = STRING | ID` while
`RosNames = ROS_CONVENTION_A | ID | 'node'` has **no `STRING` alternative**. Quoting is mandatory
in one position and a parse error in the other.

Per profile rule 15, the linter **never** flags the opposite quote character — Xtext's `STRING`
accepts both `'` and `"`, so the difference vanishes at parse time.

| `as->` | `ac->` |

### Catalogue checks (added 2026-07-23)

Two real catalogues are vendored under `../assets/`: `roscommonobjects/` (message/service/action
**type** specs, 53 packages) and `rosmodelscatalog/` (standard package **node** models, 48
nodes across 9 domains — Nav2, TurtleBot 3, arms, cameras, etc.). `build_type_index.py` /
`build_node_index.py` index them into `assets/type_index.json` / `assets/node_index.json`; these
rules consume that index. Disable all nine with `--no-catalogue` (or `ROSMODEL_NO_CATALOGUE=1`
in `--hook` mode) for a workspace whose references are heavily project-local. See `SKILL.md` §8c.

| ID | Severity | Check | Applies to |
|---|---|---|---|

| `RM087` | INFO | Consolidated: which vendored node file(s) this model needs | `.rossystem` |
| `RM088` | WARNING | `from:` reference resolves against `node_index.json`, but its source line doesn't name the resolved file | `.rossystem` |
| `RM089` | WARNING | `type:` reference resolves against `type_index.json`, but its source line doesn't name the resolved file | `.ros`, `.ros2` |
| `RM090` | ERROR | A node label is declared directly under `nodes:` **and** is also reachable through a `subSystems:` entry | `.rossystem` |
| `RM091` | WARNING | A `subSystems:` entry doesn't resolve, itself declares another `subSystems:` (nesting risk), or resolves but exposes zero `interfaces:` on any node | `.rossystem` |
| `RM092` | WARNING | A local node and a node reachable via `subSystems:` resolve the same `from:` under different labels — likely the same real node modelled twice | `.rossystem` |
| `RM093` | ERROR / WARNING | `subSystems:` written as a bracket list `[...]` (ERROR — not valid syntax) or as a multi-entry `- item` block sequence (WARNING — parses, but unverified against the real oracle for N>1) | `.rossystem` |

`RM081`/`RM084` are WARNING, not ERROR, for the same reason `RM076` is: a genuinely
project-local package/node is legitimate, and the linter cannot distinguish that from a typo of a
standard one. `RM082`/`RM085`/`RM086` are ERROR because in those cases the package/node *is*
known-complete in the catalogue, so a name that doesn't match it is a real defect, not a
plausible gap — exactly the same reasoning `RM082`'s type-side counterpart already used.

**Why this exists**: `examples/turtlebot2_navigation.rossystem` originally referenced
`nav2_amcl.amcl`, `nav2_bt_navigator.bt_navigator`, `nav2_planner.planner_server` and
`nav2_controller.controller_server` — all invented from general Nav2 knowledge with a plausible
but wrong `nav2_`-style package prefix (the real ones have no prefix at all: `amcl.amcl`,
`bt_navigator.bt_navigator`, etc.). Nothing before RM081-087 existed could have caught that
short of a full oracle run with hand-assembled dependencies.

**`RM088`/`RM089` (added 2026-07-23)** close a related but separate gap: RM081-087 make a
reference *resolve correctly*, but say nothing about whether a reader of the file itself can tell
it resolved, or to what. A user reviewing `turtlebot3_navigation.rossystem` asked exactly this —
"you only generated two `.ros2` files, what's your approach for the other seven?" — because seven
of the nine nodes point at pre-existing catalogue files with no in-file indication of that fact.
RM088 (node `from:`) and RM089 (`type:` refs) fire a WARNING whenever a reference resolves against
the catalogue but its own source line doesn't contain the resolved file's name, so the fix is
mechanically checked rather than left to memory the next time a model is authored or edited.

**`RM090`/`RM091`/`RM092` (added 2026-08-13)** close the gap a maintainer review of
`turtlebot3_navigation.rossystem` found: `from:` reuses a *node*, but reusing a whole pre-built
*system* (e.g. the base-platform bundle in `robots/turtlebot3/robot/turtlebot.rossystem`) is what
`subSystems:` is for — re-declaring nodes under `nodes:` that a `subSystems:` entry already
provides is exactly the "duplicate model definitions confusing the validator" the review flagged.
`build_node_index.py` now indexes each catalogued `.rossystem`'s nodes and their declared
`interfaces:` (never derived from the target `.ros2` — `checkIfInterfaceInSystem` doesn't either),
so `rosmodel_lint.py` can resolve a `subSystems:` reference the same way the real validator does,
one level deep. RM090 is the hard case: the same node label reachable two ways in one file. RM091
covers three ways a `subSystems:` entry itself is a problem, the most important of which is real
and common — the target resolves but declares **zero** `interfaces:` on any node (true of every
node in the vendored `turtlebot3_navigation2.rossystem`), which makes the reference grammatically
valid but useless, since nothing in it can ever be a `connections:` endpoint. RM092 is the soft
case — same `from:`, different label, possibly two genuine instances rather than a duplicate.

## Companion scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `build_type_index.py` | Rebuilds `assets/type_index.json` and `references/type-catalogue.md` from `assets/roscommonobjects/`. Run after `sync_catalogue.sh` changes anything. |
| `build_node_index.py` | Rebuilds `assets/node_index.json` and `references/node-catalogue.md` from `assets/rosmodelscatalog/`. Run after `sync_catalogue.sh` changes anything. |
| `collect_deps.py <model>... <case-dir>` | Lints the given model(s) with the catalogue enabled and copies every file their RM083/RM087 findings named into `<case-dir>` — the automated replacement for hand-copying `tests/oracle/cases/_deps/` files. |
| `sync_catalogue.sh` | Re-copies both vendored catalogues from the local `material/code` checkouts, diffs against the vendored copy, and reports what changed. Does **not** rebuild the indexes or update `PROVENANCE.md` itself — both are printed as next steps when it detects a change. |

`assets/roscommonobjects/PROVENANCE.md` and `assets/rosmodelscatalog/PROVENANCE.md` record each
catalogue's source, pinned commit (where readable), and sync date — read those before assuming
either vendored copy is current.

## Deviations from the specs, and why

Each of these is a deliberate judgment call, not an oversight.

**1. `RM002` (CRLF) is a WARNING, though emission-profile rule 3 says MUST.**
The same document states that working-tree CRLF is a `core.autocrlf=true` checkout artefact and
"MUST NOT be treated as evidence" — all 305 stored blobs are pure LF. Making this an ERROR would
fail every file in both corpora for a git setting rather than a model defect. The rule is still
reported so a generator emitting genuine CRLF is caught.

**2. `RM031` is primary over `RM035` for QoS durations.**
The task brief asked for duration-value validation (quoted digits, signed 32-bit, or `infinite`).
But grammar-subset §5.1 states those four fields must **never be emitted** — they are absent from
the pinned parser's token set, so they fail *lexing*, and §5.1 explicitly calls the duration
constraint "moot under the pinned profile … retained in documentation, not implemented as a
validator". Both are implemented: `RM031` (ERROR) fires on the field's presence, and `RM035`
additionally validates the value, so the check exists and is ready for the day the oracle is
rebuilt. Note that `validator-rules.md` §0.3 confirms `CheckQoS` is **not even present in the
shipped JAR bytecode** — so `RM035` mirrors a HEAD-only rule that the pinned oracle would neither
enforce nor reward.

**3. `default:` is accepted in parameters — the linter was right and the specs were wrong.**
Linting the corpus surfaced `default:` in real `.ros2` parameters, which the linter initially
rejected as an unknown key. Reading `Basics.xtext:72-110` showed it is legal: `default:` belongs to
the **`ParameterType`** rule (`ParameterIntegerType ::= 'Integer' ('default:' default=…)?`, and
likewise for `String`, `Double`, `Boolean`, `Base64` and `Array[T]`), not to `Parameter`. Because
`'type:' type=ParameterType` has no `BEGIN`/`END` around it, the default lands as a YAML *sibling*
of `type:`.

*Resolved 2026-07-21.* This was a genuine gap in all three spec documents, and it caused real
damage before it was closed: because the skill documented `default:` only under
`ParameterArrayType`, three of four adversarial regeneration runs concluded it was illegal on a
scalar parameter and **rewrote `default:` to `value:`** — a silent semantic change (they are
different metamodel slots) that parsed cleanly and that the linter, correctly, never complained
about. The gap is now closed in `emission-profile.md` rule 23, `SKILL.md` §9,
`references/ros2-syntax.md` §6 and the `worked-examples.md` §4 failure catalogue, and
`tests/roundtrip.py` now extracts `.default` as its own fact category so the rewrite surfaces as a
difference instead of vanishing.

**3a. `RM066` / `RM067` are linter-originated, not validator-derived.**
`RM066` (INFO) flags a `fromFile:` still holding the `TODO_PACKAGE/launch/TODO.launch.py` sentinel,
so a knowingly-synthesised path stays visible rather than passing as verified. `RM067` (INFO)
replaces a former misuse of `RM012` on `.rossystem` node labels: `checkNameConventionsNode` targets
`ros::Node`, whereas a `rossystem::RosNode` label is a different metaclass, and
`RosSystemValidator.xtend` declares **no** name-convention `@Check` at all (its only `@Check`
methods are `checkIfNodeInSystem`, `fromFileHelper`, `checkIfInterfaceInSystem`,
`checkPortPatterns`, `MatchPortMsgs`, `CheckParameter`, `BinaryHelp`, `ArrayHelp`, `ListHelp`,
`StructHelp`). Reporting it as a WARNING under a validator-derived id produced 5 spurious warnings
on `MT.rossystem` for corpus-correct names such as `static_transform_publisher_vS7Rn4YQfVmDReBi`.

**4. `RM040` is not applied to a `.rossystem` `nodes:` block.**
Profile rule 26's evidence base is `.ros2` interface and parameter blocks. Corpus B's own
`MT.rossystem` does not sort its `nodes:` block, and Corpus B is the weighted-decisive authority,
so sorting nodes is not a house rule.

**5. Interface local-name reuse *across* nodes is not an error.**
Profile rule 28 scopes uniqueness to *within a node*, and Corpus B declares `clock` in nearly every
node. An early version flagged cross-node reuse and produced 77 false errors on the reference file.
The linter now flags it only via `RM065`, when a connection actually references an ambiguous name.

**6. `RM042`/`RM043` are ERRORs although no validator detects them.**
These are the two documented silent-corruption traps: `True` falls through the `ParameterValue`
alternation into `ParameterString`, and a bare `10` under `type: Double` becomes a
`ParameterInteger`. The oracle will report neither. Silent type corruption is a worse failure mode
than a loud parse error, so the linter is deliberately stricter than the toolchain here.

**7. Tab recovery uses tab-stop 8, not a flat substitution.**
`RM001` reports tabs as a WARNING, then the file is normalised so structural checks can still run.
Expansion must advance to the next multiple of 8: a naive `\t` → `··` turns two tabs into 4 columns,
which is *shallower* than a parent indented with 6 spaces, inverting the nesting and producing
spurious "expected `<block end>`" errors. Switching to real tab-stop semantics cut YAML parse
failures on the messy `.rossystem` corpus from 14 to 7.

## Known limitations

Constraints that are **not statically checkable** in a single file, and are therefore not
implemented (severities per `validator-rules.md`):

- **R5–R10** (`CheckMsgsRef*`, WARNING) — all six test `ref.eContainer === null`, i.e. "did this
  cross-reference resolve". Needs a linking environment: the `.ros` file declaring the spec plus
  the dependency list.
- **S5** (`MatchPortMsgs`, ERROR) — Xtend `!==` is *identity* on the `EObject`, not name equality.
  Both endpoints must resolve to the **same** spec instance. `RM064` reports a name mismatch as
  INFO only; it cannot confirm or deny the real constraint.
- **S6** (`CheckParameter`, ERROR) — requires resolving `rosparam.from` into the `.ros2` parameter
  declaration. Given the defects in `CheckParameterValue` (it recurses while using *instance fields*
  as loop counters), the safe strategy is to emit scalar parameter values only; `RM045` nudges
  toward that.
- **S1/S3** are implemented only within a single file. Cross-file and subsystem-spanning cases are
  not resolved.

The linter also does **not** verify indentation against Xtext's `AbstractIndentationTokenSource`.
It checks indentation as YAML plus the profile's 2-space rule. Whether comment-only lines and blank
lines affect `BEGIN`/`END` synthesis is an open question that needs a JDK 19 to settle; `RM006` is
conservative for that reason.

## Test evidence

Everything below was **executed**. Nothing was run against the Xtext language server — see the
Java 19 blocker above.

Environment: Python 3.12.6, PyYAML 6.0.3 (`py -3` on Windows).

**Rule coverage: all 55 rule ids were fired at least once** across the corpus plus hand-built
fixtures. The rule table above and the implementation were cross-checked mechanically — every id in
the script appears in this README and vice versa, with no orphans in either direction.

> *Amended 2026-07-21.* The rule set is now **57** ids. `RM066` and `RM067` were added after that
> sweep and are **not** covered by the "fired at least once" claim above; `RM067` has been observed
> firing 5× on `tests/regenerated/manufact/MT.rossystem`, `RM066` has **not** been exercised by a
> fixture. The whole-corpus counts below also predate both rules and the `RM034` hint rewording —
> they have not been re-run.

> *Amended 2026-07-23.* The rule set is now **66** ids — `RM081`-`RM089` (catalogue checks) were
> added and are similarly **not** covered by the whole-corpus counts below. All nine were verified
> against hand-built fixtures (a resolvable ref, an unresolvable-but-plausible project-local ref,
> a typo of a real catalogued package/node/type/interface for each of RM081/082, RM084/085, and
> RM086, plus a resolvable ref with and without a disclosing comment for RM088/089) rather than a
> corpus sweep — see the commit that introduced them for the exact cases.
>
> *Amended 2026-08-13.* The rule set is now **70** ids — `RM090`-`RM093` (`subSystems:` reuse
> checks) were added, also not covered by the whole-corpus counts below. Verified against six
> hand-built fixtures (a genuine label collision — including the harder case where the colliding
> subsystem node itself exposes zero interfaces, caught by an independent review after the first
> pass missed it — a same-`from:`/different-label pair, an unresolved `subSystems:` name, a
> resolved-but-zero-interfaces target, and the bracket-list/dash-block `subSystems:` forms) plus a
> full re-lint of every catalogued `.rossystem`, `tests/regenerated/mani-ur/system.rossystem`, and
> `examples/turtlebot3_navigation.rossystem` — 0 new errors, 0 crashes, `--no-catalogue` confirmed
> to suppress RM090-RM092 (RM093 is a pure grammar check and fires regardless).

### Whole-corpus run — 336 files, 0 crashes

**Re-measured 2026-08-14** against the current script (80 emitted ids: RM000-RM093, plus the
`RM008T` variant; RM000 is the internal read/parse failure, not a rule). This supersedes the
counts the three amendments above call stale, and adds the `.ros` corpus, which the old 305-file
run predates. Both catalogue modes are given: the published table was always `--no-catalogue`
(confirmed — the one-file `CS_ros2model_TBs` `.rossystem` row reproduces its historic 2/10/5
exactly), and a catalogued workspace sees more.

`--no-catalogue` — comparable to every earlier table in this file:

| Corpus | Files | Files with ERROR | E | W | I |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `CS_ros2model_TBs` `.ros2` | 24 | 3 | 3 | 37 | 0 |
| `CS_ros2model_TBs` `.rossystem` | 1 | 1 | 2 | 10 | 5 |
| `ros-model-examples` `.ros2` | 229 | 142 | 868 | 2012 | 91 |
| `ros-model-examples` `.rossystem` | 51 | 18 | 32 | 4845 | 14 |
| `ros-model-examples` `.ros` | 31 | 0 | 0 | 389 | 247 |

Nothing regressed: every delta from the old table is a **severity reclassification already
recorded in `STATUS.md`**, not a change in what the linter sees. The `RM001` demotion (tabs are
accepted by the real language server) moves 727 `.ros2` and 2709 `.rossystem` findings from E to
W, and `RM012` → `RM067` moves 5 from W to I on the `CS` `.rossystem`. Error totals match
`STATUS.md`'s own post-demotion table row for row (32 / 868 / 0 / 2 / 3). **834 of the 868
remaining `.ros2` errors are still `RM042`** — `value: True` silently parsing as a string.

Catalogue on (default), same 336 files, 0 crashes:

| Corpus | Files | Files with ERROR | E | W | I |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `CS_ros2model_TBs` `.ros2` | 24 | 4 | 4 | 221 | 24 |
| `CS_ros2model_TBs` `.rossystem` | 1 | 1 | 38 | 41 | 6 |
| `ros-model-examples` `.ros2` | 229 | 145 | 924 | 3870 | 291 |
| `ros-model-examples` `.rossystem` | 51 | 22 | 43 | 5050 | 30 |
| `ros-model-examples` `.ros` | 31 | 0 | 0 | 414 | 258 |

The extra errors are catalogue-resolution findings on corpora the vendored catalogue was never
built from — `RM082`=57, `RM086`=43, `RM085`=4 — and the extra 2019 warnings are almost entirely
`RM089` (undisclosed catalogue provenance). Read them as "these corpora are outside the
catalogue", not as newly discovered defects; `--no-catalogue` is the right mode for them.

### Independent corroboration of the emission profile

On the clean Corpus B `.ros2` set the linter reproduced four counts that `emission-profile.md`
measured independently, exactly:

| Finding | Linter | Profile |
|---|---:|---|
| `RM003` indent not multiple of 2 | 1 | §1.1 table: one width-5 line |
| `RM005` missing final newline | 1 | §1.2: only `amcl.ros2` |
| `RM015` empty name | 3 | §1.5: 3 named files |
| `RM040` unsorted block | 3 | §1.5: 3 blocks, all caused by the empty name |

`RM058` fired exactly **2** times across the messy corpus, matching profile §1.5's "only 2
duplicate local names exist corpus-wide, both in Corpus A".

### Positive control

The two canonical reference outputs from `emission-profile.md` §4 (`nav2_amcl.ros2` and
`manufacturing_tb.rossystem`, the latter with `fromFile:` added per rule 7) lint **completely
clean — 0 findings, exit 0**. The linter agrees with the profile's own normative examples.

### Negative controls

Hand-built fixtures with planted defects. All were caught with the expected severity, and the
*valid* constructs in the same files produced no findings:

- `.ros2`: uppercase package (ERROR) vs uppercase artifact/node (WARNING); unquoted `/`-bearing
  type ref; bad QoS enum; quoted QoS enum; negative `depth`; `lease_duration`/`liveliness`;
  `True` under `type: Boolean`; `10` under `type: Double`; `type: Any`; `msgs:` block; quoted
  package name; `my.artifact` and `some/deep/name` in RosNames positions; `deadline: "5000000000"`
  correctly flagged as int32 overflow while `lifespan: "1000"` was not.
- `.rossystem`: `fromFile` without `/`; duplicate local name within a node; unquoted arrow target
  and `from:`; process referencing a ghost node; reversed connection (`sub->` in the `from` slot);
  mismatched pairing (`pub->`→`sc->`); unknown endpoint; 1-element connection. The three legal
  connections (`pub`→`sub`, `ss`→`sc`, `as`→`ac`) produced **no** findings.

### Degradation paths

- **Tab-indented files** (25 `.rossystem`, 24 `.ros2` have leading tabs): reported as `RM001`
  ERROR with a clear message, then normalised so structural checks still run — never an opaque
  YAML crash.
- **PyYAML absent** (simulated by blocking the import): layout checks run in full, structural
  checks reported as skipped via an INFO finding, exit 0, no traceback.

### Genuine defects found in the corpus

Not linter bugs — real problems, verified by reading the source lines:

- `MT.rossystem` (the *clean* reference file) declares **`bt_navigator` twice** (lines 45, 215) and
  **`robot_state_publisher` twice** (lines 3, 242) in the same `nodes:` mapping. `yaml.safe_load`
  silently keeps only the last, so rossdl loses a node without any warning.
- `pickQrCode.rossystem:162` contains a C-style `/* … */` comment inside a flow sequence. The
  grammar has `SL_COMMENT` (`#`) only and **no block-comment syntax**, so this is invalid in both
  YAML and the DSL.
- Four Corpus B `.ros2` files order `actionservers:` before `serviceservers:` — the deviation
  `emission-profile.md` §5 row 24 deliberately declines to adopt. `RM039` correctly reports them.
