ros_studio.py -- the Python companion for /ros-studio, an interactive authoring editor for
RosTooling models. The editor itself is a self-contained vanilla-JS page (no network); this
script owns everything the browser cannot: seeding a project from existing files,
DETERMINISTIC file generation, and REAL validation against rosmodel_lint (always) and the
language-server oracle (opt-in).

    ros_studio.py init [FILE.rossystem | DIR ...] [--out project.json] [--name NAME]
        Build a project.json. With a .rossystem argument, seed from it: reuse ros_plot's
        extractor for the system structure and open the sibling .ros2 files (via
        rosmodel_lint's compose) to recover each interface's type and the artifacts'
        parameters, the sibling .ros files to recover the message FIELDS, and a line-oriented
        pass to recover the COMMENTS (PyYAML discards them). Every comment that cannot be
        attached to a model element is reported. Several files, or a directory, are indexed
        across the whole tree and MERGED into one project (ids re-issued, colliding node
        labels renamed, a subSystems: reference to a system that is itself being merged
        collapsed onto it). With no argument, emit a blank project.

    ros_studio.py render project.json [--out ros-studio.html] [--open]
        Emit the self-contained editor HTML, with the three autocomplete datasets
        (message/service/action types, package names, node catalogue) embedded so
        autocomplete works offline.

    ros_studio.py generate project.json [--outdir DIR] [--oracle|--no-oracle] [--diff]
        Deterministically emit .ros2 / .rossystem / companion .ros (reusing rosmodel_lint's
        vocabulary), then run rosmodel_lint over the result.

        The real language server is then asked BY DEFAULT whenever it can run: catalogue
        dependencies are staged (collect_deps) and ask_oracle drives the jar. rosmodel_lint's
        RM rules are a deliberate approximation of the Xtext validator, so a run that consulted
        only them has not been fully checked -- and used to say nothing about that. If the jar
        or a Java 19+ runtime is missing, the reason is reported on stdout, on stderr, AND in
        the editor's own error surface (<project>.notice.html, whose banner opens on load);
        the run still exits 0, because the files were written and the lint passed.

        --oracle REQUIRES the real server: not being able to run it is an error.
        --no-oracle skips it entirely and reports nothing about it.

        On a generation/lint ERROR, or a rejection by the real server, re-render the editor with
        the diagnostics injected onto the offending nodes (written next to the project as
        <project>.error.html). With --diff, also print the model-level diff against the seed
        source (see below).

    ros_studio.py diff project.json [--against FILE.rossystem] [--json]
        What changed since the seed. Compares the GENERATED model against the .rossystem the
        project was seeded from (project["seededFrom"]) at the MODEL level -- nodes,
        exposures, connections, parameters, artifacts, message specs -- not as text, because
        the emitter's fixed key order, quoting and sorting make a text diff unreadable.

This SUPERSEDES /ros-plot for authoring; /ros-plot stays as the lightweight read-only path.

# Comments: capture at seed, re-emit at generate
#
# `generate` used to write only its own provenance comments, so every explanatory comment the
# author had written was deleted on the first edit cycle -- 30+ of them on the TurtleBot 3
# example. PyYAML discards comments outright, so the linter's compose path cannot help; the
# capture below is a separate line-oriented pass keyed by the ELEMENT a comment annotates
# rather than by line number, because a line number does not survive an edit and an element
# identity does.
#
# POLICY (asserted by tests/studio_roundtrip.py, stated in commands/ros-studio.md):
#   PRESERVED   a leading comment block attaches to the next modeled element; a trailing
#               comment attaches to the element on its own line. Modeled elements are: the
#               system, each subSystems: entry, each node, each exposure, each node-level
#               parameter exposure, each system-level parameter (plus its `type:`/`value:`/`ns:`
#               lines), each connection; and in the .ros2 the package, each artifact, each
#               interface (plus its `type:` line) and each parameter.
#   NORMALISED  indentation follows the emitted element, not the source; the `# ` spacing is
#               normalised; and a leading block that preceded a block KEY (`nodes:`,
#               `interfaces:`, ...) re-emerges before the FIRST element inside that block,
#               because the model has no slot for the key itself.
#   DROPPED     everything the project model does not carry -- `processes:`, `qos:` internals,
#               and trailing comments on block keys.
#               `init` REPORTS every one of these with its line number (SKILL.md rule 12)

    I have silent failures!"

      1. proc.returncode was never checked. ask_oracle.py could print an ACCEPTED line and then
         die, and the substring test below would still call it a pass.
      2. The verdict was `"ACCEPTED" in out and "REJECTED" not in out` over stdout+stderr. That
         is a text search over a stream that also carries diagnostic MESSAGES and a stderr tail,
         so a model whose own text contained either word decided its own verdict.
      3. ask_oracle.py returns 0 even when every case failed to run: NO_INITIALIZE_RESPONSE and
         MISSING_JAR are per-case *statuses*, and a case that never got a diagnostic back still
         printed "ACCEPTED — 0 error(s)". A server that timed out was indistinguishable from a
         model with nothing wrong with it.
