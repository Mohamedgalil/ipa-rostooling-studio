# RosTooling model generation

Emit files for an **indentation-sensitive Xtext DSL**. It looks like YAML. It is not YAML.
Indentation is lexed into mandatory `BEGIN`/`END` tokens; a wrong indent is a parse error, not a
style nit.

`$ARGUMENTS` is the target: a path to a ROS 2 package, or a bare system name (emit a
`.rossystem`). If empty, ask which of the two the user wants before emitting anything.

**When it is a path with source in it, start at "Converting real source" below — running the
extractors is mandatory, not a shortcut.** One `.ros2` per *package*, named after the package it
declares (see *Output layout*), not one per node.

## When to use

- Authoring or fixing `.ros2`, `.rossystem`, or `.ros` files.
- Converting a ROS 2 package / launch file / node introspection dump into RosTooling models.
- Reviewing an existing model against the grammar and validators.

## When not to use

- Writing actual ROS 2 C++/Python code, launch files, or `package.xml` — those are the *input*.
- Anything URDF. **Never inline URDF, XML, or a robot description into a model file.** A robot
  description reaches a model only as a `type: String` parameter whose value is a quoted path or an
  empty string `""`.
- `.ros1` files. Out of scope.

## Converting real source: run the extractors first — MANDATORY

**When `$ARGUMENTS` is a path and that path contains ROS 2 source, you MUST run
`scripts/extract_ros2_interfaces.py` before writing any `.ros2` by hand**, and
`scripts/extract_rossystem.py` before writing a `.rossystem` when launch files exist. This is not
a convenience. Transcribing `create_publisher`/`create_subscription`/`declare_parameter` calls is
mechanical whenever the name and type are literal, and doing it by reading is slower,
non-reproducible, and measurably worse: two independent runs of this skill over one package
produced *different* names (`query_state` vs `~/query_state`) for the same non-literal interface,
each looking equally confident in the file.

```bash
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/extract_ros2_interfaces.py <src> \
    -o <project>/rosnodes --emit-msgs <project>/msgs --json <project>/extraction_record.json

python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/extract_rossystem.py <launch-file> \
    --models <project>/rosnodes -o <project>/<system>.rossystem --json <project>/system_record.json
```

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is set when the plugin is installed; working inside the plugin repo it is
not, and the paths are simply `scripts/extract_ros2_interfaces.py` and
`scripts/extract_rossystem.py`. If the first invocation fails with "No such file or directory",
that is which case you are in — it is not a reason to skip the step.

`scripts/README.md` documents what each reads and emits; it is the authority, so do not restate
it from memory. The short version: everything that is literal in the source, already cited.

**What they emit is settled — do not re-derive it or "improve" it, and do not re-read the source
to check it.** Your job is the remainder, and only the remainder.

### The `# FLAG` comments are your worklist, not documentation

The scripts emit only what is literal and turn everything else into a `# FLAG` comment in the file
header carrying `file:line` and the source expression. **A model that still contains `# FLAG` is
not finished.** Every flag is one §8e decision. `rosmodel_lint.py` counts them as **`RM097`**
(WARNING) so this does not rest on you remembering self-check 18 — but note that a flagged file
is otherwise clean, and the real oracle ACCEPTS it, so RM097 is the *only* signal that anything
is outstanding.

**Delete a flag only when you have actually put the thing it describes into the model.** If you
cannot resolve it, keep the marker (`# FLAG`, or reworded to `# OPEN`/`# UNRESOLVED`) and say so
in your report. Turning an unresolved flag into a prose note is the one way to make an unfinished
model look finished to every check there is.

Where a name is built from literals plus one identifier, the flag already carries the evidence:

```
#   Built from 'side', which 2 construction site(s) of HandSide visible in this package pass
#   as: 'left', 'right'. CANDIDATES (evidence, NOT emitted ...): /hand/left/cmd, /hand/right/cmd
```

That is §8e case 1 already half-done. **Confirm it — do not re-derive it, and do not take it on
faith either.** The script cannot see construction sites outside the package, so check whether any
exist; if the candidates hold, emit one interface per resolved value and cite both lines per §8e.

### The two exemptions, and nothing else

1. **No ROS 2 source on disk.** The scripts report `0 package(s)`; a repository whose `src/` holds
   only READMEs and CMakeLists is the common case for a partial checkout. Say so and model from
   whatever the caller did supply. Do not re-run hoping for a different answer.
2. **Missing dependencies.** C++ needs `tree_sitter` + `tree_sitter_cpp`; both scripts' YAML
   readers need PyYAML. Without tree-sitter every C++ package is skipped, and the summary line
   says so and **names them** (`INCOMPLETE: the C++ source of N package(s) was NOT read`).
   Without PyYAML, `generate_parameter_library` parameters and the controller config are not
   read, so `extract_rossystem.py` cannot resolve controller instances and says so. Either
   install them (`pip install tree_sitter tree_sitter_cpp pyyaml`) or read those packages
   yourself — and say which, in the report.

Prose-only requests, transcription of an existing model, and review tasks are outside this section
— there is no source to extract from.

## Decision tree: which file

| You need to express | File | Root rule |
|---|---|---|
| Message / service / action **type definitions** | `.ros` | `Package_Impl` — has `msgs:` / `srvs:` / `actions:` |
| A **package + its nodes' interfaces** (pubs, subs, services, actions, params) | `.ros2` | `AmentPackage` — has `fromGitRepo:` / `artifacts:` / `dependencies:` |
| **Composition**: which nodes run together, and what connects to what | `.rossystem` | `RosSystem` — has `nodes:` / `connections:` |

**The rule people get wrong:** `.ros2` uses `AmentPackage`, which has **no `msgs:` / `srvs:` /
`actions:` block**. `Ros2.xtext` opens with `@Override Package returns Package: AmentPackage;`, so
`AmentPackage` is the entry rule and `Package_Impl` is unreachable. Those three keywords *do* appear
in the parser's token table — that is a decoy, not permission. Message specs live in `.ros` files
only. Zero of 253 corpus `.ros2` files contain a `msgs:` block.

A `.ros2` file's `type:` values are **references** into `.ros` specs; the `.ros2` never defines them.

**A package that both defines and consumes its own types needs both files.** The table above reads
as if the three tasks were disjoint; they are not. Whenever any `type:` reference's package prefix
equals the `.ros2`'s own package name — `turtlesim` publishing `'turtlesim/msg/Color'` and serving
`'turtlesim/srv/Spawn'` — a companion `.ros` in the same model project is **required**, or
`CheckMsgsRefPublisher` warns on every such interface. Emit it without being asked.

### Output layout

Mirror the layout both corpora use, because `from:` cross-references resolve through the Xtext
workspace and not through relative paths:

```
<project>/
  msgs/<package>.ros            type definitions
  rosnodes/<package>.ros2       one file per package, named after the DECLARED package name
  <system>.rossystem            beside rosnodes/, not inside it
```

Name each `.ros2` after the package name it declares on line 1, not after the node. (76 of 253
corpus files violate this; do not copy them — but always *read* the package name from the model, per
rule 10.) Whether cross-file linking is directory-scoped or workspace-scoped is **unverified** —
`RosSystemScopeProvider` is an empty class, so stock Xtext scoping applies, and this cannot be
confirmed without a running language server.

## Before emitting: inventory the request

When the composition is described in prose rather than transcribed from an existing model, write
down — before the first line of output — every construct the caller asked for, one per line:

- each pre-built composition to reuse ("reuses a composition called X … as a subsystem" →
  `subSystems:` entry `"X"`)
- each node, with the artifact/node it wires in
- each interface to expose, each parameter to set, each connection, each process

Emit, then tick the list off against the file. A requested construct that is not in the file is a
defect even when the file lints and validates clean — the linter cannot see the request. The only
legitimate reason to leave an asked-for construct out is a hard rule in this document, and then
check 12 requires you to name the construct and the rule.

This exists because of a concrete failure: a request that named a subsystem to reuse in its opening
sentence and then spent sixty lines on five nodes and twenty-five parameters. Two independent
attempts emitted the five nodes perfectly and silently dropped the `subSystems:` block; the same
reuse in a two-paragraph request that had nothing else to say was emitted every time. Busy requests
lose their preamble.

## Hard rules, ranked by how often an LLM breaks them

### 1. Quoting discipline (the #1 failure)

`EString returns ecore::EString: STRING | ID;` — Basics.xtext:391.
`ID` admits `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*` only. So **any name containing `.`, `/`, `::`, `-`, a space,
or that is empty MUST be double- or single-quoted**, or it is a parse error.

Emit quotes as follows:

| Position | Quote | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `.ros2` interface name, parameter name, `type:` **message ref** | `'single'`, always — even when bare would parse | removes a per-name decision |
| `.ros2` parameter `value:` string, `fromGitRepo:` | `"double"` | it is data, not a reference |
| every quoted token in `.rossystem` (`from:`, arrow target, interface label, param ref, `fromFile:`) | `"double"`, always | Corpus B is 100% double there |
| `.ros2` package name (col 0), artifact name, `node:` name | **NEVER quoted** | `RosNames` has no `STRING` alternative |
| parameter **type keywords** (`Boolean`, `String`, `Double`, `Integer`, `Array[String]`) | **NEVER quoted** | they are grammar keywords; quoting one is a parse error |

```
RosNames returns ecore::EString:
    ROS_CONVENTION_A | ID | 'node'          # Basics.xtext:394-396 — no STRING branch
```

Corpus: 253/253 package names bare, 267/267 `node:` names bare, 0 quoted.

### 2. Lowercase package names — the only naming ERROR

`checkNameConventionsPackage` calls `error(...)`, not `warning(...)`. Any uppercase character in a
`.ros2` root package name is an **ERROR**, and the loop does not short-circuit, so `MyPkg` yields
two errors.

- Package name (`.ros2` line 1): `[a-z0-9_]` **only**. MUST.
- Node and artifact names: lowercase preferred, but uppercase is only a WARNING — **do not mangle an
  upstream name to satisfy it.** `gazebo_sensor_B1_controller` is a real, correct artifact name.
- Parameter names: uppercase warns only if the remainder of the name contains no `.`. So `Foo.bar`
  is clean; `foo.Bar` warns.

This produces a deliberate asymmetry inside one file — lowercase package, original-case artifact:

```
gazebo_sensor_b1_controller:
  artifacts:
    gazebo_sensor_B1_controller:
      node: gazebo_sensor_B1_controller
```

### 2a. Package, artifact and node are three distinct names — all three matter for launch generation

Confirmed directly by the plugin maintainer (review of `examples/turtlebot3_navigation.rossystem`,
2026-08-13), matching the same three-tier shape already established by rule 4b/`RosQNP.xtend`:

```yaml
planner_server:            # the ROS 2 package name
  artifacts:
    planner_server:         # the executable to run
      node: planner_server  # the name given to the node, visible to rosgraph
```

These are frequently the same string (as above), but they answer different questions and are
**not interchangeable placeholders for each other** — never collapse them because they happen to
match in a given package. Getting the wrong one into the wrong DSL position is exactly what rules
4b, 6, and the RM014/RM056/RM062 lint checks exist to catch: `rossdl_cmake` (the actual launch-file
generator this composition feeds) derives the node's runtime class from `from:`'s **node** segment
and keys its remapping table on the **artifact**'s bare name, so confusing package ↔ artifact ↔
node produces a `.rossystem` that lints and validates clean but generates a broken launch file —
a defect this plugin cannot detect on its own, since it never runs `rossdl_cmake` itself.

### 3. Indentation

Spaces only, **exactly 2 per level**, LF endings, one trailing newline, no tabs, no trailing
whitespace, no blank lines inside an indented block. The corpus is inconsistent (26/51 `.rossystem`
files contain tabs) — **do not imitate it.** Emit the normalised form.

### 4. Connection direction and type identity (`.rossystem`)

`from` is **always** the server/publisher side. Only three pairings are legal:

| `from` | `to` |
|---|---|
| `pub->` | `sub->` |
| `ss->` | `sc->` |
| `as->` | `ac->` |

`MatchPortMsgs` additionally compares with Xtend `!==` — **object identity**, not name equality.
Both endpoints must resolve to the *same* spec object, so emit byte-identical `type:` strings on
both ends.

Use only the `RosSystemConnection` form, `- [from_label , to_label]`, referencing interface **labels
declared in the same file**. The `RosConnection` alternative triggers a `ClassCastException` in
three separate validator methods.

**Never synthesise a `connections:` block that the source did not declare.** When transcribing an
existing system that has no `connections:`, emit none — even when pub/sub pairs look obvious.
`MatchPortMsgs` requires *object identity* on the type, which cannot be confirmed without resolving
every referenced `.ros2`, so an invented connection is an unverifiable claim that may hard-error.
Instead, list the candidate label pairs in your response and let the caller decide. (`MT.rossystem`
has 32 nodes and several obvious pairings — such as `relay`/`controller_server` on
`kmriiwa/base/command/cmd_vel` — and declares zero connections. Leave it that way.)

`extract_rossystem.py` computes those candidate pairs for you — same interface name, same type
string, legal direction — and writes them to its `--json` record without emitting any. **That list
is for your report, not for the file.** Having the pairs computed changes nothing about this rule:
name and type equality is necessary but not sufficient, because `MatchPortMsgs` compares by object
identity. Scoping to one launch file does prune the obviously wrong ones — on
`bringup_onboard.launch.py` it leaves exactly one candidate — but "one candidate" is still a
proposal for the caller, not a licence to wire it.

### 4b. `from:` is `package.NODE`; arrow targets are `artifact::interface`

Inside a single `.rossystem`, references into a `.ros2` use **two different naming schemes**. Get
this backwards and the reference silently fails to link.

| Position | Form | Level skipped |
|---|---|---|
| `from:` | `"<package>.<node>"` | the **artifact** |
| `pub->` `sub->` `ss->` `sc->` `as->` `ac->` target | `"<artifact>::<interface>"` | the **package** |
| node-level parameter target | `"<artifact>::<parameter>"` | the **package** |

Not a convention — it is what `RosQNP.xtend` computes. For a `Node` it returns
`pkg.name + "." + node_name` from `obj.eContainer.eContainer as Package`; for a `Publisher` (and the
other five kinds, and `Parameter`) it returns `art.name + "::" + interface.name` from
`obj.eContainer.eContainer as Artifact`. Same expression, different class, opposite level.

Worked example — `MANI01_UR/pick_and_place.ros2` is the one corpus file where all three names
differ:

```
moveit2_scripts:                                 package
  artifacts:
    pick_and_place:                              artifact
      node: simple_pick_and_place_applictation   node
      publishers:
        attached_collision_object: ...           interface
```

```
from:  "moveit2_scripts.simple_pick_and_place_applictation"   ✅ package.NODE
from:  "moveit2_scripts.pick_and_place"                       ❌ package.artifact — does not link
arrow: "pick_and_place::attached_collision_object"            ✅ ARTIFACT::interface
arrow: "simple_pick_and_place_applictation::attached_..."     ❌ node::interface
```

Almost every corpus file has `artifact == node`, so it never notices. **When they differ, say which
one you used in your response.** Detail: `references/rossystem-syntax.md` §3.

### 5. `fromFile:` — always emit it, always with a `/`

`fromFileHelper` dereferences `system.fromFile` **twice with no null guard**, and the field defaults
to `null` when omitted. Omitting `fromFile:` is corpus-normal and trips the bug. `fromFile: ""` also
errors. The only input that traverses the method cleanly:

```
fromFile: "my_pkg/launch/bringup.launch.py"
```

**This is the one field where the skill knowingly supplies data the source does not contain**, so
it needs a derivation ladder rather than a guess. 32 of 52 corpus models omit `fromFile:`, so
"no launch file is known" is the *common* case, not the edge case:

1. The caller named a launch file → use it verbatim.
2. `<pkg>/launch/<system>.launch.py` exists on disk (check with `Glob`) → use the real path.
3. Otherwise → `fromFile: "TODO_PACKAGE/launch/TODO.launch.py"`.

Rung 2 means the launch file itself — a `*.launch.py` you found with `Glob` — not a `fromFile:`
line you found in another model. Corpus models, `assets/rosmodelscatalog/*.rossystem`,
`examples/`, and this plugin's own `tests/regenerated/` outputs are *models*; a path in one of
them is that author's claim, and in `tests/regenerated/` it is this skill's own earlier guess.
Copying it launders a guess into a fact. A path that reached you any way other than rung 1 or
rung 2 is rung 3: emit the sentinel, and mention in your report where you saw the candidate path
so the caller can confirm it.

The sentinel satisfies the `contains("/")` check while staying obviously a placeholder. **Never
invent a plausible-looking real path** — a fabricated `"cs4mt_bringup/launch/manufacturing_tb.launch.py"`
is indistinguishable from a verified one and silently converts a known-unknown into a false fact.

Say which rung on the line itself, the same way §8c discloses catalogue sources:

```
fromFile: "ur_bringup/launch/ur5e.launch.py"   # caller-supplied
fromFile: "ur_bringup/launch/ur5e.launch.py"   # on disk: /abs/path/ur_bringup/launch/ur5e.launch.py
fromFile: "TODO_PACKAGE/launch/TODO.launch.py"
```

The sentinel needs no comment (`RM066` already marks it). `RM096` warns when any other
`fromFile:` has no provenance comment.

On rung 2, report the on-disk path you confirmed. On rung 3, report **SYNTHESISED — not extracted
from the source, supplied only to avoid the `fromFileHelper` NPE** and, if you saw a candidate path
somewhere that you rejected as not being rung 1 or rung 2 evidence, say where. The linter flags the
sentinel as `RM066` (INFO) so it stays visible.

### 6. Node names: never quoted, restricted charset

`node:` takes `RosNames`, so it can never be quoted and can never contain `.`, `-`, `::`, or a
space. Leading/trailing slashes *are* legal (`ROS_CONVENTION_A: ( ('/' ID) | (ID '/') )*`) and are
attested in the corpus (`/light_controller`, `/cam_ns/cam_frame_controller`) — but prefer a plain
`ID`. See the correction note in `references/ros2-syntax.md`.

### 7. QoS durations — quoted 32-bit ints (moot under the pinned profile)

If `lease_duration:` / `lifespan:` / `deadline:` are ever unpinned, each value must be a **quoted**
digit string parseable by `Integer.parseInt` (max `2147483647` ns ≈ 2.1 s — `"5000000000"` is an
ERROR) or the bare keyword `infinite`. Under the current profile you never emit these fields at all
(§ below), so this rule is documentation for a future oracle rebuild, not something to implement.

### 8. Silent-corruption traps in parameter values

- Booleans: **lowercase only**. `terminal BOOLEAN: 'true'|'false'`. `True` does not error — it falls
  through the `ParameterValue` alternation into `ParameterString`, so a `type: Boolean` parameter
  silently holds a *string*. No validator catches it. 910 corpus occurrences are latently corrupt.
- Doubles: **must carry a `.` or exponent**. `value: 10` under `type: Double` silently becomes a
  `ParameterInteger`. Emit `10.0`.
- Lists: a list value is bracket syntax with double-quoted elements — `value: ["a", "b"]`, one
  space after each comma. A quoted string whose *content* is bracket-shaped —
  `value: "['a', 'b']"` — is a `ParameterString`, and `CheckParameterValue` rejects it against an
  `Array[…]`/`List[…]` parameter with `Expect a list of elements` (ERROR; seen four times in one
  file against the real server). Real project `.ros2` files carry this defect
  (`type:Array [String]` over `value: "['x', 'y']"`). **It is a source defect, not a style to
  preserve.** The declared type wins: when the referenced `.ros2` declares `Array[…]`/`List[…]`,
  or the caller wrote the value as a list, emit the real list and report the conversion under
  check 12 ("source held the list as a quoted string; emitted as a list"). `RM095` flags the
  string form in both file types.
- Never emit an empty name `'':`.

### 8b. `.ros` message bodies — emit the FIELDS, not just the type name

A `.ros` spec is not just a list of type names. `MessageDefinition` expands, and dropping the
fields silently destroys the entire content of the file. This is the single largest information
loss this skill has produced: an adversarial test asked for `Pose` and got a bare `message` line,
losing all five of `float32 x`, `y`, `theta`, `linear_velocity`, `angular_velocity`.

**A field is two bare tokens — type, then name — four indent levels deep:**

```
turtlesim:              level 0   package
  msgs:                 level 1   block keyword
    Pose                level 2   spec name — NO trailing ':'
      message           level 3   body keyword
        float32 x       level 4   FIELD  (column 8)
        float32 y
        float32 theta
```

`srvs:` uses `request` / `response` at level 3, `actions:` uses `goal` / `result` / `feedback`.
The spec name at level 2 is the only named element in the language with no trailing `:`.

Two things a `.ros` allows that a `.ros2` does not: the root is `PackageSet`, so **one file may
declare several packages** at column 0; and `MessagePart*` has no line separator, so **several
fields may share a line**. Emit one package per file and one field per line anyway — but never
flag either as an error when reading a source file.

| Form | Write | Not |
|---|---|---|
| scalar | `float32 x` | — |
| array | `float32[] xs` | `float32[3] xs` — **no bounded arrays exist**, it is a lexer error |
| `time` / `duration` / `Header` | `time stamp` | `time[] stamps` — these three have **no array form** |
| ref to any spec, incl. **own package** | `"pkg/msg/Type" field` | `Type field` — bare short names never resolve |
| array of refs | `"pkg/msg/Type"[] fields` | — |
| constant | `uint8 FAN_OFF=0` | `uint8 FAN_OFF = 0` — spaces split the token |

Legal scalar keywords: `bool` `int8` `uint8` `int16` `uint16` `int32` `uint32` `int64` `uint64`
`float32` `float64` `string` `byte` `char` `time` `duration` `Header`. Arrays are the same list
minus `time`/`duration`/`Header`, with `[]` appended. Field names may be grammar keywords
(`string name`, `int32 type`) and are never quoted.

**Emit the fields whenever the input supplies them.** An empty body is grammatically legal — a
bodiless `message`, or a `response` with no fields, is a correct transcription when the source
genuinely has none. But falling back to it because you did not know the syntax is data loss, and
if you ever do emit a bodiless spec you must say so: *"message bodies omitted — field definitions
were not available in the input."*

`references/ros2-syntax.md` §11.

### 8c. Resolve every `type:` and `from:`/arrow reference against the vendored catalogues

Two real catalogues are vendored into this plugin — `assets/roscommonobjects/` (message/
service/action **type** specs, indexed in `assets/type_index.json`) and
`assets/rosmodelscatalog/` (standard package **node** models, indexed in
`assets/node_index.json`). Browsable tables: `references/type-catalogue.md`,
`references/node-catalogue.md`.

**Before emitting any `type:` reference**, resolve it against `assets/type_index.json`. If it
resolves, use the catalogue's exact spelling (package name, kind, and Type all come from a real,
oracle-shaped source, not memory). If it does not resolve, one of two things is true: the package
is genuinely project-local — emit a companion `.ros` defining it — or the reference was invented
and must not be emitted. `rosmodel_lint.py`'s RM081 (WARNING, package not indexed at all — a
project-local package is legitimate) and RM082 (ERROR, package indexed but this type isn't —
this is a real typo, not a plausible gap) enforce this at lint time and suggest the nearest match.

**Before emitting any `.rossystem` `from:` or arrow/parameter target**, resolve it the same way
against `assets/node_index.json`. This is exactly the mistake that shipped in an earlier
revision of `examples/archive/turtlebot2_navigation.rossystem`: `nav2_amcl.amcl`, `nav2_bt_navigator.
bt_navigator`, `nav2_planner.planner_server` and `nav2_controller.controller_server` were all
invented from general Nav2 knowledge with a plausible `nav2_`-style prefix — the real catalogue
names are `amcl.amcl`, `bt_navigator.bt_navigator`, `planner_server.planner_server`,
`controller_server.controller_server`, no prefix. `rosmodel_lint.py`'s RM084 (WARNING, `from:`
package not indexed — project-local nodes are legitimate), RM085 (ERROR, package indexed but node
name isn't) and RM086 (ERROR, arrow/parameter target resolves to a catalogued node but that
interface name isn't among its real interfaces) enforce this the same way.

**TurtleBot 2 / Kobuki is not in `assets/rosmodelscatalog/` at all** — only TurtleBot 3 is. A
reference to a Kobuki-specific package will always miss the catalogue; that is a known scope
limit of the vendored catalogue, not a defect to fix by guessing a plausible package name for it.

Once a reference resolves, `rosmodel_lint.py` reports which vendored file supplies it (RM083 for
types, RM087 for nodes) — pass the model straight to `scripts/collect_deps.py <file>... <dir>` to
stage exactly those files into an oracle case directory, instead of hand-copying `_deps/` files
and guessing which ones apply.

**Disclose the resolved file inline, on the same line as the reference — not only in a header
comment.** A reader looking at one `"from:"` line should not have to run the linter, open
`assets/node_index.json`, or scroll to a file-level summary comment to find out which real file
backs it. This matters concretely: a `.rossystem` can reference nine nodes where seven resolve to
pre-existing catalogue files nobody in this session wrote, and two resolve to files freshly
authored for this model — from the reference alone those two cases are visually indistinguishable
unless each line says which one it is. Add a trailing comment naming the exact vendored path:

```
"amcl":
  from: "amcl.amcl" # assets/rosmodelscatalog/navigation/amcl.ros2
```

For a project-local node with no catalogue entry, say so instead, e.g. `# project-local, see
rosnodes/turtlebot3_mission_manager.ros2` — the point is that every `from:` line states in-place
whether it points at a real vendored file (and which one) or a companion file this session wrote.
`rosmodel_lint.py`'s RM088 (node `from:`) and RM089 (`type:` refs) check this mechanically: they
fire a WARNING when a reference resolves against the catalogue but the source line's text doesn't
contain the resolved file's name.

### 8d. Reuse a whole pre-built system via `subSystems:` — emit it when asked; the exposure check governs wiring, not whether to emit

`from:` names *one node's* real implementation. To reuse a whole pre-built `.rossystem`
composition — not re-derive it node by node — use the system-level `subSystems:` block instead:

```
subSystems:
  "turtlebot"
```

**Not a bracket list.** The grammar production is `components+=SubSystem*`, a repetition, not
`Process.nodes`'s `[...]` form — one bare (quote it anyway, per §8) system name per indented line,
no leading `-`. `subSystems: ["turtlebot"]` is a parse error.

**If the caller says a composition exists elsewhere and asks to reuse it, emit the entry** — even
when the target is not among `assets/node_index.json`'s `_systems` and no `<name>.rossystem` sits
beside the file. An unresolved entry is RM091 (WARNING, "does not resolve"), which is the correct,
*disclosed* outcome for a project-local system kept elsewhere: say so in your report. Omitting the
entry instead silently changes what the deployment brings up, and nothing — not the linter, not
the oracle — can detect it. The exposure check below decides whether a node *inside* the subsystem
can be a `connections:` endpoint; it never decides whether the subsystem is referenced at all.

**Before wiring a connection *through* a subsystem, check what it actually exposes.** A subsystem's
connectable ports are *exactly* what its own `nodes:` block declares under `interfaces:` — **never**
derived from the `.ros2` file its `from:` points at (confirmed directly against
`RosSystemValidator.xtend`'s `checkIfInterfaceInSystem`, which walks one level into a referenced
system's components and reads `rosnode.rosinterfaces` — populated only from that file's own
`interfaces:` blocks). Two real catalogued examples show both outcomes:

- `assets/rosmodelscatalog/robots/turtlebot3/robot/turtlebot.rossystem` declares real
  `interfaces:` on all three of its nodes (`cmd_vel`, `tf`, `odom`, `scan`, `joint_states`,
  `tf_static`) — genuinely reusable. Referencing it exposes those bare labels directly as
  `connections:` endpoints (confirmed against the real oracle — no re-suffixing, no artifact
  prefix, just the subsystem's own label text).
- `assets/rosmodelscatalog/robots/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_navigation2.rossystem` (the Nav2 stack)
  declares **zero** `interfaces:` on any of its 14 nodes. Referencing it via `subSystems:` is
  grammatically valid and resolves, but exposes nothing — none of its nodes can be a
  `connections:` endpoint through it. If a node from a subsystem like this needs external
  wiring, **declare that one node explicitly under `nodes:` as well** (and mind RM090 — if the
  same label is then reachable both ways, keep the explicit node and say in a comment why the
  subsystem does not supply it), so a future pass doesn't "simplify" it into a broken
  `subSystems:` reference. This is not a failure to reuse — the reference genuinely offers nothing
  to reuse.

`assets/node_index.json`'s `_systems` entries (built by `build_node_index.py`) record each
catalogued system's nodes and their declared interfaces, so this is checkable before authoring
anything: an entry with every node's `"interfaces": {}` is the zero-exposure case above.

**Never let one real node be reachable two ways in the same file** — directly under this file's
own `nodes:` **and** through a `subSystems:` entry that also provides it. Two distinct `RosNode`
objects then answer to the same label, which is the concrete shape of "duplicate model
definitions confusing the validator." `rosmodel_lint.py`'s RM090 (ERROR) catches the exact-label
collision; RM092 (WARNING) catches the softer case of the same `from:` reachable under two
different labels. RM091 (WARNING) covers a `subSystems:` entry that doesn't resolve at all, nests
another `subSystems:` block (two levels deep throws `ClassCastException` in the real validator —
keep nesting flat), or resolves but exposes zero interfaces, as above.

### 8e. When an interface name or message type isn't literal in the source: trace it, infer it from a cited convention, or ask — never a silent guess, never a silent drop

Most interfaces resolve straight from the literal source: a string topic name and a message class
both sit in the same `create_publisher`/`create_subscription`/... call, or one hop away in a
well-known alias. Handle those exactly as everywhere else in this document — read, transcribe, cite
`file:line`.

**This section does not loosen any other rule.** It is about reading *source code* that resolves
with work. It never licenses inventing a `connections:` block (§4), a `fromFile:` path (§5), or a
catalogue reference that does not resolve (§8c) — a type you infer here must still resolve against
`assets/type_index.json` or come with a companion `.ros`, and a node/package name is never inferred
by convention at all. QoS fields and parameter values are out of scope: never infer either. Emit
only what the source states, and let the Pinned-oracle exclusion section's defaults stand.

**When the source was extracted (see "Converting real source"), your worklist is exactly the
script's `# FLAG` comments** — the literal cases are already emitted and cited, so every remaining
decision is one of the three below. A flag that carries a `CANDIDATES:` line is case 1 with the
enumeration already computed; confirm it against the source rather than re-deriving it, and note
that the script only sees the package it was given.

Three situations arise, each with one correct move.

**1. It takes tracing, not transcription.** A `using FollowJTrajAction = ...` alias two lines up; a
Python variable or dict entry holding a message class; a name built from pieces that are all
determinable — `get_node()->get_name() + "/query_state"`, or a `side` variable assigned two frames
away. Trace it and cite **both** lines: the call site and the thing that resolves it. This is not a
guess — everything needed is in the source. Reading for meaning is the whole reason **this step**
— resolving what is not literal — is done by a model and not by a syntactic extractor, so do the
reading before reaching for case 2 or 3. It is not a reason to redo the extractor's work on the
parts that *were* literal: those are settled.

Python shapes that need the same treatment: a message class imported under an alias or held in a
variable/dict; a topic read back from `self.declare_parameter('topic_name', '/scan')` — the
**declared default** is the name, cite the `declare_parameter` line; a name assembled from
`self.get_name()`, a namespace, or an f-string.

When the pieces are enumerable — `side` ranges over `"left"` and `"right"`, a loop over a list of
joint names — **emit one interface per resolved value**, not one interface with the variable left in
it and not just the first. If the range is not enumerable from the source, that is case 3.

**2. It genuinely isn't in the source, but one answer is forced by a citable basis.** A topic named
`cmd_vel`/`odom`/`scan`/`imu`/`tf` whose type lives in a header you cannot see or a dynamically
loaded plugin. You may infer it **only** against something you can name: a REP, the `common_msgs`
family, this project's own precedent for the same topic name elsewhere, or an unambiguous local
pattern (identical sibling constructs in the same file, all carrying one type). General familiarity
with "what ROS projects usually do" is not a basis. Two further gates, both hard:

- the inferred type must resolve against `assets/type_index.json` per §8c — an inference that
  misses the catalogue is not an inference, it is an invention;
- exactly one candidate must survive. If two types are each plausible, this is case 3.

Mark it in place. §8c already claims the trailing comment on that line, so **merge the two into one
comment** — provenance first so RM089 still sees the resolved filename:

```
'cmd_vel':
  type: 'geometry_msgs/msg/Twist' # assets/roscommonobjects/geometry_msgs.ros — INFERRED from the topic name (REP-119), no type in source; confirm
```

Keep it a trailing comment: a full-line comment at column 0 ends the model (RM094).

**3. Neither applies.** No trace resolves it and no single basis picks one answer. Before you may
use this case you must have actually looked: grepped the symbol across the package, checked the
node's headers and `package.xml` dependencies, and checked whether the catalogue already models
this node. Case 3 is for a genuine dead end — a header outside the tree, a config value, a plugin
you cannot see into — not for a file you did not finish reading.

Then ask the caller, once: collect **every** open question in the whole model into a single message,
naming for each the node, the interface, the candidates considered, and what is missing. Do not ask
one at a time and do not stall the rest of the model waiting.

If no answer is available — a batch or non-interactive run — do not guess and do not fail. Leave the
interface out, report it under check 12 as *UNRESOLVED — asked, no answer available*, and give it a
table row. This mirrors §5's rung-3 sentinel: a known-unknown stays visibly unknown.

**Mandatory: every model-generation report ends with an "Assumptions & Inferences" table**, in your
response to the caller, whether or not case 2 or 3 ever fired. One row per inferred, assumed, or
unresolved construct — message types are the highest-stakes case but not the only one. This is
structured disclosure and does **not** replace check 12's prose report of drops and synthesis; a
construct you dropped under case 3 appears in both.

| Construct | Source | Case | What was inferred | Basis | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `hand_bridge` subscriber `/hand/left/cmd`, `/hand/right/cmd` | `hand_bridge.cpp:77`, `side` at `hand_bridge.cpp:149-150` | 1 | name assembled from `side` ∈ {`left`,`right`}; both emitted | traced in source | high |
| *(illustrative — not a real project; shows the case-2 shape only)* `battery_node` publisher `/battery/status` | `battery_node.cpp:40`, message type not visible — declared in a header outside this package's tree | 2 | type `sensor_msgs/msg/BatteryState` | `/battery/status`-style topics are `sensor_msgs/msg/BatteryState` by REP-widespread convention and by this catalogue's own precedent for the same name; only one candidate resolves in `type_index.json` | medium |

`Confidence` is exactly one of **high** (case 1, fully traced), **medium** (case 2, single citable
basis), **low** (case 2 where the basis is weaker than a REP or catalogue precedent, or case 3
answered by the caller from memory). Anything you would call lower than low is case 3.

An empty run states so explicitly — `Assumptions & Inferences: none — every emitted construct traced
to a literal or to an unambiguous local resolution` — never omit the section. Its absence must never
be the reader's only signal that nothing needed it.

### 9. Ordering (grammar-fixed — violating is a parse error)

| Rule | Mandatory order |
|---|---|
| `AmentPackage` | `fromGitRepo:` → `artifacts:` → `dependencies:` |
| `.ros2` interface | `type:` → `ns:` → `qos:` |
| `.ros2` parameter | `type:` → **`default:`** → `ns:` → `value:` → `qos:` |
| `.rossystem` node | `from:` → `namespace:` → `interfaces:` → `parameters:` |
| `.rossystem` **system-level** parameter | `ns:` → `type:` → `default:` → `value:` (no `qos:`) |

`default:` belongs to `ParameterType`, not to `Parameter`, and is legal on **every** scalar type —
not only on `Array[T]`. It has no `BEGIN`/`END` of its own, so it sits as a sibling of `type:`
immediately after it. **`default:` and `value:` are different slots and are never interchangeable**
— preserve whichever the input uses.

**When the input is source code there is no slot to preserve, so choose by meaning: a compiled-in
`declare_parameter()` or `generate_parameter_library` default is a `default:`.** That keeps
`value:` for the *deployed* value, which comes from a launch file or a controller config and
belongs in the `.rossystem`, not here. The extractors emit `default:` for this reason; a
transcribed corpus file using `value:` for the same thing is preserved as-is per the rule above,
so the two can legitimately differ between a generated and a transcribed model of one package. See `references/ros2-syntax.md` §6.

The two `parameters:` shapes in a `.rossystem` are different rules and are easy to confuse — the
node-level one is a **list** (`- "name": "node::param"` + `value:`), the system-level one is a
**mapping** with a `type:`. See `references/rossystem-syntax.md` §5 and §5b.

Convention (grammar permits any order): node blocks go `publishers` → `subscribers` →
`serviceservers` → `serviceclients` → `actionservers` → `actionclients` → `parameters`; interface
labels unique within a node (`sub_clock` when `clock` is already taken by a publisher).

**Sorting is scoped per file type — it is not a blanket rule:**

| Block | Order |
|---|---|
| `.ros2` interface entries, parameter entries, `artifacts:` | **sort alphabetically** |
| `.rossystem` interface labels within a node | **sort alphabetically**, grouped by kind |
| `.rossystem` `nodes:` | **preserve source order** — it often encodes bring-up sequence |

`rosmodel_lint.py` matches this split: `RM040` fires on unsorted `.ros2` blocks and deliberately
does **not** fire on a `.rossystem` `nodes:` block.

## Pinned-oracle exclusion

**Updated 2026-07-21 — this restriction has been lifted.** It previously said *never emit* the four
newer QoS fields, because our only validator was a JAR built 2024-08-01, predating them. We rebuilt
the language server from current source, so `lease_duration:`, `liveliness:`, `lifespan:` and
`deadline:` now parse and validate correctly.

**Prefer the five long-standing fields anyway** — `profile:`, `history:`, `depth:`, `reliability:`,
`durability:`. Emit one of the four newer fields only when the input specifically calls for it.
Two reasons: no corpus model uses them, and anyone consuming your output on an older toolchain
build cannot lex the keyword — it fails as a **syntax error that invalidates the whole publisher**,
not as a warning.

**If you do emit a duration** (`lease_duration:`, `lifespan:`, `deadline:`), the value is in
**nanoseconds** and must fit a signed 32-bit int — max ≈ **2.147 seconds** — or be the literal
`infinite`. `deadline: "5000000000"` (5 s) is a validator ERROR. This is the easiest QoS mistake to
make, because every realistic timeout exceeds the limit.

The complete emittable QoS vocabulary:

```
qos:
  profile:     default_qos | services_qos | sensor_qos | parameter_qos
  history:     keep_last | keep_all
  depth:       <bare integer>
  reliability: best_effort | reliable
  durability:  transient_local | volatile
```

Default to **`reliability:` and `durability:` only** — the only two Corpus B uses. Emit
`profile:` / `history:` / `depth:` solely when the caller supplies a concrete value.

Cost of the exclusion is zero: **0 of 253** corpus `.ros2` files use any of the four fields.
Because the JAR's token set is a strict subset of HEAD's, output valid under this profile is also
valid at HEAD.

Also never emit: `Any`, `ParameterAny`, `Date` (defined but not members of the `ParameterType` /
`ParameterValue` alternations — unreachable), or nested `Struct` **values**.

---

## Self-check before finishing

Run every line against the emitted file:

1. Line 1 package name: lowercase `[a-z0-9_]`, **unquoted**, ends with `:`.
2. No tabs. Every indent is a multiple of 2. LF endings. Exactly one trailing newline.
3. Every `.ros2` interface/parameter name is `'single-quoted'`; every `type:` message ref is
   `'single-quoted'` and contains `/`.
4. Every parameter type keyword is bare. Every string `value:` is `"double-quoted"`.
5. No `msgs:` / `srvs:` / `actions:` in a `.ros2` file.
6. `lease_duration` / `liveliness` / `lifespan` / `deadline` are **legal** — emit them when the
   source has them (the restriction was lifted 2026-07-21; see §11). Never delete one to satisfy
   this checklist: that would drop a concrete value the source carried. Two value rules do apply:
   a duration is a nanosecond string and must be under ~2.147 s (`Integer.parseInt`, RM035), and
   `liveliness:` is `automatic` or `manual`, bare — any other value is a parse error (RM033).
7. Booleans lowercase; every `.ros2` `Double` value has a `.` or exponent. In a `.rossystem` the
   declared type is not on the line — open the referenced `.ros2` and read it
   (`references/rossystem-syntax.md` §5). Preserve the source literal only for scalars whose type
   you cannot resolve; never preserve a bracket-shaped string where the declared type is
   `Array`/`List` or the caller gave a list — see §8.
8. Block order matches §9. `.ros2` entries alphabetical; `.rossystem` `nodes:` in **source order**.
   Any `default:` in the input is still a `default:` in the output, never rewritten to `value:`.
9. `.rossystem` only: `fromFile:` present, quoted, contains `/`, and is one of exactly three
   things — the caller's verbatim value, a `Glob`-confirmed on-disk launch file, or the sentinel —
   with the rung stated in a trailing comment. Anything else is fabricated: replace it with the
   sentinel. Every connection is `- [a , b]` where `a` is a `pub->`/`ss->`/`as->` label and `b` is
   the matching `sub->`/`sc->`/`ac->` label. Both `type:` strings identical. Every label declared
   in this file. Every node in a process's `nodes: [...]` declared in `nodes:`.
10. `from:` in `.rossystem` is `<packageName>.<nodeName>` — **the node, never the artifact** — read
    from the **model contents**, never from the `.ros2` filename (76/253 files have a stem that
    differs from the declared package; `bt_navigator.ros2` declares `nav2_bt_navigator`). In the
    same file the arrow targets are `<artifactName>::<interfaceName>`. Two different schemes; see
    rule 4b.
11. `.ros` only: every spec that has fields in the input **has those fields in the output**, two
    bare tokens per line at indent level 4, spec name at level 2 with no trailing `:`. No bounded
    arrays. Every spec reference — including one into the file's own package — is a quoted
    `"pkg/msg/Type"`. Constants have no spaces around `=`. See §8b.
12. **Report what you dropped or synthesised.** Before finishing, tell the caller about: every
    comment removed from a transcribed source (file, line, text — *DROPPED PROVENANCE*); any
    `fromFile:` from rung 3 of the ladder (*SYNTHESISED*), and where you saw a rejected candidate
    path if you saw one; any `.ros` message body emitted bodiless; any duplicate node label
    collapsed or renamed; any source defect preserved verbatim, and separately any source defect
    you *converted* rather than preserved (a list held as a quoted string is always converted, not
    preserved — see §8); any construct the request asked for — subsystem, node, interface,
    parameter, connection — that you did not emit, and which rule excluded it. Silence about these
    is the failure mode — none of them is visible to the linter or the harness.
13. Every `type:` reference resolves against `assets/type_index.json`, and every `.rossystem`
    `from:`/arrow/parameter target resolves against `assets/node_index.json` — or is a genuine,
    disclosed project-local reference with its own companion `.ros`/`.ros2`. See §8c.
14. Every resolved `type:`/`from:` reference names its exact vendored source file in a trailing
    comment on the same line (`# assets/rosmodelscatalog/navigation/amcl.ros2`), and every
    project-local one says so and points at its companion file instead. See §8c.
15. If the request named a pre-built composition to reuse, a `subSystems:` block naming it is
    present — unresolved is acceptable (RM091 WARNING, disclosed in the report); absent is not.
    Every entry is the bare-per-line form, never `[...]`. Before routing a *connection* through a
    subsystem, confirmed via `assets/node_index.json`'s `_systems` entries that the target
    declares `interfaces:` on the node you need; if it declares none, that node also needs an
    explicit `nodes:` entry. No node is reachable both directly under this file's `nodes:` and
    through a `subSystems:` entry. See §8d.
16. Requirements coverage: every construct in the inventory you wrote before emitting (see
    "Before emitting: inventory the request") is in the file, or is named in your report together
    with the rule that excluded it.
17. Every name/type that wasn't literal in the source was handled one of three ways (§8e): traced
    (case 1 — cites both the call site and the resolving line), inferred from a citable convention
    (case 2 — resolves against `assets/type_index.json`, carries the merged provenance+`INFERRED`
    trailing comment, names its basis), or asked about and, absent an answer, left out and reported
    (case 3). The "Assumptions & Inferences" table is present in the report — with the explicit
    "none" line when nothing needed it — and does not replace check 12's prose report of drops and
    synthesis.
18. **Every `# FLAG` is accounted for, and deleting one is not the same as answering it.**
    Delete a flag comment **only** when the thing it describes is now actually in the model
    (§8e case 1/2, with its citation). If it stays unresolved (case 3), **leave the marker in
    place** — rewrite the text if you like, but keep it starting `# FLAG`, `# OPEN` or
    `# UNRESOLVED` — and name it in the report. Rewording a flag into prose makes a model with
    known holes look finished, and it is the one failure mode nothing else catches: such a file
    lints clean and the real oracle ACCEPTS it. The `# EXTRACTOR-FLAGS: N` line the scripts write
    is a record of how many there were; do not edit it. `RM097` reports it against how many are
    still open. `# DROPPED`/`# NOTE`/`# CAUTION` are the scripts' disclosures of things the DSL
    cannot express, not a worklist: leave them in place.
19. **The extractors were run**, per "Converting real source", or the report names which of the two
    exemptions applied (no source on disk / missing dependencies, saying which packages were
    therefore read by hand). Anything the scripts emitted is unchanged unless a §8e resolution
    required editing that exact line.

## Validation

- **The extractors run the linter themselves** on everything they write, so a file that came out of
  `extract_ros2_interfaces.py` / `extract_rossystem.py` has already passed it once. Re-run it after
  your §8e edits — those are hand edits like any other.

- **Static linter** (always available): `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/rosmodel_lint.py`. Checks
  everything above that is decidable in one file.

  ```
  python scripts/rosmodel_lint.py <file>...
  ```

  On Windows under the Bash tool, bare `python` is the Microsoft Store stub and exits non-zero —
  use `py -3` there. Accepts **`.ros`, `.ros2` and `.rossystem`**. (`.ros` support was added
  2026-07-21; older notes saying `.ros` is rejected with `RM000` are stale.) The `.ros` branch does
  not use YAML — it runs its own indentation-stack parser, so it reads message field lines
  correctly and never rejects a file merely for irregular indentation.

  **`RM034` (`profile:` / `history:` / `depth:` used) is expected and correct when the value came
  from the input.** It warns against *inventing* those fields, not against transcribing them.
  Never drop a concrete value that was present in the source in order to get a clean linter run.

  **`RM095`/`RM096` (added 2026-09-03) close two gaps a live validation round found.** `RM095`
  (ERROR in `.rossystem`, WARNING in `.ros2`) fires on a parameter value that is a quoted string
  shaped like a list (`value: "['a', 'b']"`) — see §8's Lists bullet; this is a real oracle
  rejection, not a style nit, so it is wired into the `--hook` PostToolUse gate. `RM096`
  (WARNING) fires on a non-sentinel `fromFile:` with no `# caller-supplied` / `# on disk:`
  provenance comment (files under `assets/rosmodelscatalog/` are exempt) — see rule 5. **`RM061`
  (`subSystems:` used) was demoted from WARNING to INFO in the same pass** — its presence was
  never itself a defect, and the old WARNING read as a third nudge toward omitting a subsystem
  the caller actually asked to reuse; see the "Before emitting: inventory the request" section
  and §8d.

  **RM081-092 are the catalogue checks** (§8c, §8d) — RM081/084 (WARNING: reference not indexed
  at all, a project-local package/node is legitimate) and RM082/085/086 (ERROR: the package/node
  *is* indexed but this specific type/node/interface name isn't — a real typo, with a
  suggested nearest match) run automatically whenever `assets/type_index.json` /
  `assets/node_index.json` exist. Pass `--no-catalogue` to suppress them in a workspace whose
  references are heavily project-local. RM083/RM087 name exactly which vendored file a
  resolved reference needs — feed the model straight to `scripts/collect_deps.py <file>...
  <case-dir>` instead of hand-copying `_deps/` files (this also stages any resolved
  `subSystems:` target and follows its own references transitively). RM088/RM089 (WARNING) fire
  when a reference resolves against the catalogue but its source line doesn't name the resolved
  file — add the trailing comment they suggest. RM090 (ERROR)/RM091/RM092 (WARNING) are the
  `subSystems:` reuse checks from §8d: a node reachable both directly and through a subsystem, an
  unresolved/nested/zero-interface subsystem reference, and a same-`from:`-different-label pair.
  RM093 is a separate, non-catalogue grammar check (`--no-catalogue` does not suppress it), and
  it is an **ERROR** on both illegal forms: the bracket list `subSystems: [...]` and the `- item`
  block sequence, at any number of entries. `components+=SubSystem*` is a repetition, not a list
  production: **N references are N bare lines**, and the dash form is a syntax error
  (`mismatched input '-' expecting RULE_END`). Settled 2026-08-14 against the 3.1.0 server —
  oracle cases `17-subsystems-multi` (two bare lines, ACCEPTED 0E/0W) and
  `18-neg-subsystems-dash` (REJECTED). Write:

  ```
  subSystems:
    "turtlebot"
    "extra"
  ```

  Two consequences worth carrying: this is the one legal form that **`yaml.safe_load` cannot
  read** (two consecutive scalars do not compose; unquoted ones fold into a single scalar), so a
  YAML-based consumer such as `rossdl` cannot load a multi-entry model at all — flag it, do not
  try to write around it. And a full-line comment at **column 0** anywhere inside an indented
  block ends the model (`missing EOF`, RM094): indent every comment to the block it annotates.

- **Round-trip harness**: `tests/roundtrip.py`, which compares two models semantically rather than
  byte-wise (corpus formatting is far too inconsistent for byte-diffing to mean anything).

  ```
  python tests/roundtrip.py compare <original> <regenerated>
  ```

  The `compare` subcommand is **required** — `roundtrip.py <a> <b>` is an argparse error.
  `compare` exits 1 on any semantic difference, including the deviations this skill *mandates*
  (an added `fromFile:`, a renamed duplicate node label). Read the diff; a non-zero exit is not by
  itself a failure.
- **Real oracle — PREREQUISITE: a Java 21 runtime.** The language-server jars are Java 21
  bytecode; on Java 11 or 8 they fail with `UnsupportedClassVersionError` before validating
  anything. Check with `java -version`, and if it is older, either put a JDK 21 on `PATH` or point
  `ROSMODEL_JAVA` at one. **If no Java 21 is available, say so in your report and describe the
  model as linter-checked only** — do not present it as oracle-validated. (An earlier revision of
  this file asserted "Java 21 is installed" as a fact; that was true of one machine and is not a
  property of the toolchain.) With that in place,
  `tests/oracle/ask_oracle.py` drives the actual RosTooling language servers over stdio:

  ```
  py tests/oracle/ask_oracle.py <case-dir>      # one directory = one LSP workspace
  py tests/oracle/ask_oracle.py --all           # the whole regression suite
  ```

  Put the file under test in a directory together with every `.ros` it depends on, and read the
  verdict. `ACCEPTED` with 0 errors is the only passing result.

  **`ACCEPTED` is necessary, not sufficient.** A draft still carrying `# FLAG` comments is
  ACCEPTED by the oracle and clean in the linter apart from `RM097` — every automated signal
  says "done" while the model has known holes. **A model with a non-zero `RM097` is not
  finished** unless every surviving flag is named in your report with the reason it stays
  (§8e case 3). Do not read "0 errors" as a licence to hand it over; check `RM097` too.

  **The shipped `ros2` JAR registers `RosIdeSetup` and `BasicsIdeSetup` as well as `Ros2IdeSetup`,
  so it validates `.ros` files too** — not just `.ros2`. A `.rossystem` server has now been built
  locally as well (`build/rossystem-ls/`), so all three file types have an oracle.

  **A `.ros2` is only clean when every `type:` it references resolves.** Unresolved references are
  **ERRORs** (they fail in Xtext's linking layer, before the validator runs), not warnings.
  Validating one file in isolation will always show errors — always supply the `.ros` dependencies.

- **The oracle is the rebuilt 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT server**, one unified binary for `.ros`, `.ros2`
  and `.rossystem`, and it validates the current language — including the four QoS fields above,
  which is why they are no longer excluded. The 2024-08-01 JAR is still reachable as
  `ROSMODEL_ORACLE=legacy` for A/B work: it is what a *consumer* on an older build sees, and the
  difference is exactly what RM031 reports at INFO.

- **When the linter and the oracle disagree, the oracle wins.** The linter is a reimplementation;
  the oracle is the toolchain. Report a file as validated only if you actually ran it.
